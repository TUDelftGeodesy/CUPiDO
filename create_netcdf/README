CUPiDO - Connecting Undifferenced Points in Deformation Observations

Matlab toolbox for the generation of NetCDF files with the CUPiDO
schema.

The directory contains five files:

    cupido_write_netcdf.m
        Function to write a CUPiDO NetCDF file.

    cupido_check_netcdf.m
        Function to check the content of a CUPiDO NetCDF file.

    cupido_read_netcdf.m
        Function to read a CUPiDO NetCDF file.

    cupido_read_netcdf2struct.m
        Function to read a CUPiDO NetCDF file and output to
        struct array.

    cupido_merge_netcdf.m
        Function to merge two CUPiDO NetCDF files.

An example on the use of the write function is given in the example
directory.
