CUPiDO - Connecting Undifferenced Points in Deformation Observations

The CUPiDO software enables a standardized approach for the analysis
and preparation of geodetic data for the use in geophysi-
cal modeling. The approach resolves the problem of non-
uniformity in the datasets obtained by different measurement
techniques. 

The approach is based on two main steps: uniformization
of the data using a standardized data format (NetCDF), and
the application of the CUPiDO conversion tool to construct
double-difference observations.

The CUPiDO software is structured in three directories:

    create_netcdf
        scripts to generate the standardized NetCDF data files
        (currently in Matlab only).

    create_double_differences
        conversion tool to generate an optimal set of double 
        differences based on the NetCDF data files (in Python2).
