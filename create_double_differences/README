CUPiDO - Connecting Undifferenced Points in Deformation Observations

The CUPiDO conversion tool creates the optimal set of double-difference geodetic
(GPS and leveling) measurements and its corresponding covariance matrix 
based on the user input: Period of interest (POI), Region of interest (ROI),
and technique of interest (TOI). 

The software includes one main function and eight subfunctions:
   
    cupido.py (main function)
        For the detailed description of Inputs/Outputs of cupido.py, see
            the header of cupido.py.     

    construct_sd2dd_transformation_gps.py
        This subfunction constructs the single-to-double difference transformation
        for both leveling and GPS data.
	
    construct_sd2dd_transformation.py	
        This subfunction constructs the single-to-double difference transformation
        for both leveling and leveling data.

    construct_st_idealization_covmx.py
        This subfunction constructs the covariance matrix associated with the 
        spatio-temporally correlated component of idealization noise.

    construct_t_idealization_covmx.py
        This subfunction constructs the covariance matrix associated with the 
        temporally correlated component of idealization noise.
	
    csv_idealization_reading.py
        This subfunction reads the idealization noise parameters from the database	     
	(See the header of 'cupido.py' for more info about the input database).

    csv_polygon_reading.py
        This subfunction reads the polygon of the ROI.

    netcdf_reading.py
        This subfunction reads the geodetic observations from the database
        (See the header of 'cupido.py' for more info about the input database)

    cupido_logging.py
        Logging subfunction.

For the detailed description of Inputs/Outputs of cupido.py, see the 
header of cupido.py.
