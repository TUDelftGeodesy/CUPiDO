CUPiDO - Connecting Undifferenced Points in Deformation Observations

This directory contains an example setup to demonstrate the CUPiDO 
functionality.

The example can be executed by running two files:

    cupido_example_step1.m
        Matlab script to simulate data and generate example NetCDF
        files with leveling and GPS data. The user can change the
        simulation settings in the file.

    cupido_example_step2.py
        Python2 script to convert the data in the NetCDF files to
        an optimal set of double-differences. The user can change
        the selection settings (area of interest, period of interest,
        technique of interest, etc.)
