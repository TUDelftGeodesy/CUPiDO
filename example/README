CUPiDO - Connecting Undifferenced Points in Deformation Observations

This directory contains an example setup to demonstrate the CUPiDO functionality.

The example can be executed by running three files:

    cupido_example_step1.m
        Matlab script to simulate data and generate example          NetCDF files with leveling and GPS data. The user can change the
        simulation settings in the file.

    cupido_example_step2.py
        Python2 script to convert the data in the NetCDF files to
        an optimal set of double-differences. The user can change
        the selection settings (area of interest, period of  interest, technique of interest, etc.)

    cupido_example_step3_example_modeling.m
        Matlab script to apply the inversion of two parameters of   the Mogi model (i.e. depth and rate of the volume change), by direct search of a user-defined search space. The user can change the simulation and search space settings.
